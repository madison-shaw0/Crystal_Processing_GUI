Title: Crystal Processing GUI

Description:
This GUI was made as a part of my SURFO Internship at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography. 
It assists with data analysis of polygon annotations from volcanic rock SEM images in JSON file format exported from CoralNet-Toolbox.
With this GUI, you can create images of annotation outlines, perimeter and area distributions, and major vs. minor axis (aspect ratio) graphs.
There's also a tab where you can view crystal counts and percentages per individual image.

To be worked on:
Letting the user change and store scales from the GUI
Spacing issues
